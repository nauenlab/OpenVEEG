# Read_LSL_EEG_matlab 

This is a simple program to read EEG from any telemetry/wired EEG device connected to a computer via a National Instruments BNC Data Aqcuisition board.
This syncs the data to LabStreamingLayer, a program which is detailed here: https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer. For proper use of this program see dependencies.

# Dependencies:

This program requires Matlab and the Matlab Signal Acquisition Toolbox as well as LabStreamingLayer
LabStreamingLayer is an open source tool provided by the Schwarz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD. After downloading LSL, add the liblsl-Matlab folder from the LSL folder into the read_EEG_LSL folder. 
Its original documentation can be found here: https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer.

The WIKI contains an example of the UI and how to use the program.
